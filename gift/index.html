Never before have I met someone who has a thought process so in line with me, who has such a pure, loving and caring heart, and who I can be so silly and myself with. When I first brought you to my house to hang out, what surprised me most was how I found this dora who I was instantly so comfortable with and felt that I could talk and be myself around so easily. The best decision of my life was to go with my gut and for the first time make the first move on a girl I needed more in my life. Ever since then, I never looked back. And here I am, coding this shady website to the best of my abilities to continue showcasing my affection and admiration for my favorite person in the world. I never want go stop doing this.
